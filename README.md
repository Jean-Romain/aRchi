# aRchi

The aRchi package provides a set of tools to manipulate, visualize and compute metrics from quantitative structural model of trees (i.e the so-called QSM) . It can be used in various context of forest ecology (i.e biomass estimation) and tree architecture (i.e architectural metrics). The package is based on a new S4 class called `aRchi`.
